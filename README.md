kuwt-agent is an AI-powered tool designed to help you "Keep Up With Technology" by intelligently fetching and curating content based on your interests and expertise level.

## How It Works

1. **Topic Selection**
    - Specify your areas of interest (e.g., Machine Learning, Web Development, DevOps)
    - Indicate your knowledge level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)

2. **Source Discovery**
    - AI automatically identifies top-quality sources matching your topics
    - Sources are ranked based on credibility, relevance, and content depth

3. **Content Curation**
    - Fetches and analyzes content from selected sources
    - Adjusts technical complexity to match your expertise level
    - Filters out redundant or irrelevant information

## Features

- Dynamic source selection based on user preferences
- Expertise-level aware content delivery
- Multi-format content support (articles, documentation, tutorials)

## Benefits

- Save time finding reliable learning resources
- Get content matched to your knowledge level
- Stay updated with the latest developments in your field
- AI-driven insight retrieval and summarization
- Customizable notification channels
- Modular and extensible architecture

## Workflow

1. **Configuration**
    - Set up your tech interests in `config.json`
    - Define expertise levels for each topic
    - Configure update frequency and notification methods

2. **Source Management**
    - Agent scans and validates configured sources
    - Creates source reliability index
    - Establishes content update schedules

3. **Content Processing**
    - Fetches new content from validated sources
    - Analyzes technical complexity and relevance
    - Filters and categorizes information

4. **Delivery**
    - Generates personalized content summaries
    - Adapts technical depth based on user level
    - Delivers through configured channels

5. **Feedback Loop**
    - Tracks user interaction with delivered content
    - Updates source rankings
    - Refines future content selection

## Technical Requirements

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI for REST endpoints
- SQLAlchemy for data persistence
- Redis for caching
- BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping
- transformers (Hugging Face) for NLP tasks
- Docker for containerization
- pytest for testing

### Core Components

#### ContentFetcher
- `fetch_content(source_url: str) -> RawContent`
- `validate_source(source_url: str) -> bool`
- `update_source_index(source: Source) -> None`

#### ContentAnalyzer
- `analyze_complexity(content: str) -> ComplexityScore`
- `extract_topics(content: str) -> List[Topic]`
- `generate_summary(content: str) -> str`

#### UserManager
- `update_preferences(user_id: str, preferences: Dict) -> None`
- `get_expertise_level(user_id: str, topic: str) -> ExpertiseLevel`
- `track_interaction(user_id: str, content_id: str) -> None`

#### ContentDelivery
- `format_content(content: Content, user_level: ExpertiseLevel) -> FormattedContent`
- `send_notification(user_id: str, content: FormattedContent) -> bool`
- `schedule_delivery(content: Content, timestamp: datetime) -> None`

#### DataModels
```python
class Source:
    url: str
    reliability_score: float
    update_frequency: timedelta
    last_update: datetime

class Content:
    raw_text: str
    complexity_score: float
    topics: List[Topic]
    source: Source

class UserProfile:
    interests: List[Topic]
    expertise_levels: Dict[Topic, Level]
    notification_preferences: NotificationConfig
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Configure your sources and notification preferences.
4. Run the agent to start receiving technology updates.
